## Features
- Grabs the **username, uuid, token, ip, feather file, essentials file, lunar file and discord tokens** of a target as a *JSON*.
- Apparently switching the feather or essential files with yours grants you infinite access to their account thanks to the **refreshToken**.
- Additionally, it stores a **formatted session string** ready to use with [TokenAuth]
- JavaScript backend server which:
  - Checks if all fields in the JSON are present.
  - Controls requests and filters out spam requests by IPs.
  - Validates the token with Minecraft Auth servers before proceeding to output the data.

  It also fakes returning 404 codes to make the people think they successfully crashed the server ðŸ¤¡.
  
- Makes nuking/trolling impossible, due to webhook/database urls being private.
- Can be easily be hosted on *Heroku*. 
- Can be easily configured to either use `Discord Webhooks` or `MongoDB` or both.
- Bypasses PizzaClient's SessionProtection.
